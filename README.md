# self-aggregation
This project will result in a simple model for convective clustering 
A number of N cells will be put on random positions and attract each other. 
If two cells are comming close together they will merge together and build a bigger convective cell. 
If one cell remains the simulation will stop. 
The caculation of the cell displacement will use an adaptive time step withe a maximum travel length per time step
